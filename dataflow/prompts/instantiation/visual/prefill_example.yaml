    observation: |-
      I observe the canvas state is a Word document with a body containing a paragraph with a run element, which has a text element 'text to edit'.

      My task is to detail the given task and give the step-by-step actions to take. 
      The user needs to delete text in the Word document. 
      Based on the canvas state, there is a text element 'text to edit'.
      And based on the available apis and controls,the user can use "select_text" to select the target to delete,and "type_keys" to type in delete.
      Therefore,the user can detail the task to delete 'text to edit' in the Word document.
      In this case, the user should select the text to edit in the Word document and press the 'Delete' key on the keyboard to delete the selected text.

      My task is to detail the given task and give the step-by-step actions to take. 
      The user needs to highlight text in the Word document. 
      Based on the canvas state, there is a text element 'text to edit'.
      And based on the available apis and controls,the user can use "select_text" to select the target to highlight and then to highlight the text.
      Since there is no "Highlight" button available,I should click to the 'Home' tab first and then click the 'Highlight' button.
      Therefore,the user can detail the task to highlight 'text to edit' in the Word document.
      In this case, the user should select the 'text to edit' in the Word document and press the 'Home' button and 'Highlight' button respectively.
    new_task: |-
      Highlight 'text to edit' in the Word document.

      {{"step 3":"click the highlight button to finish highlight","controlLabel": "", "controlText": "Highlight", "function": "click_input", "args": {{"button": "left", "double": false}}}}
