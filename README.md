    <img src="./assets/overview_n.png"/> 
</h1>


## 🕌 Framework
<b>UFO</b> <img src="./assets/ufo_blue.png" alt="UFO Image" width="24"> operates as a multi-agent framework, encompassing:
- <b>HostAgent 🤖</b>, tasked with choosing an application for fulfilling user requests. This agent may also switch to a different application when a request spans multiple applications, and the task is partially completed in the preceding application. 
- <b>AppAgent 👾</b>, responsible for iteratively executing actions on the selected applications until the task is successfully concluded within a specific application. 
- <b>Application Automator 🎮</b>, is tasked with translating actions from HostAgent and AppAgent into interactions with the application and through UI controls, native APIs or AI tools. Check out more details [here](https://microsoft.github.io/UFO/automator/overview/).

Both agents leverage the multi-modal capabilities of GPT-4V(o) to comprehend the application UI and fulfill the user's request. For more details, please consult our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07939) and [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/UFO/).

## ✨ Getting Started


### 🛠️ Step 1: Installation
UFO requires **Python >= 3.10** running on **Windows OS >= 10**. It can be installed by running the following command:
```bash
# [optional to create conda environment]
# conda create -n ufo python=3.10
# conda activate ufo

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/UFO.git
cd UFO

# Create a Python virtual environment
# Replace 'python3' with 'python' if your system uses that alias
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows (Git Bash or cmd.exe)
# .venv/Scripts/activate
# On macOS/Linux (bash/zsh)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the requirements within the activated environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you want to use Qwen as your LLM, uncomment the related libs in requirements.txt before installing.

# To deactivate the virtual environment later, simply run:
# deactivate

```

### ⚙️ Step 2: Configure the LLMs
Before running UFO, you need to provide your LLM configurations **individually for HostAgent and AppAgent**. You can create your own config file `ufo/config/config.yaml`, by copying the `ufo/config/config.yaml.template` and editing config for **HOST_AGENT** and **APP_AGENT** as follows: 


#### OpenAI
```bash
VISUAL_MODE: True, # Whether to use the visual mode
API_TYPE: "openai" , # The API type, "openai" for the OpenAI API.  
API_BASE: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", # The the OpenAI API endpoint.
API_KEY: "sk-",  # The OpenAI API key, begin with sk-
API_VERSION: "2024-02-15-preview", # "2024-02-15-preview" by default
API_MODEL: "gpt-4-vision-preview",  # The only OpenAI model
```

#### Azure OpenAI (AOAI)
```bash
VISUAL_MODE: True, # Whether to use the visual mode
API_TYPE: "aoai" , # The API type, "aoai" for the Azure OpenAI.  
API_BASE: "YOUR_ENDPOINT", #  The AOAI API address. Format: https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com
API_KEY: "YOUR_KEY",  # The aoai API key
API_VERSION: "2024-02-15-preview", # "2024-02-15-preview" by default
API_MODEL: "gpt-4-vision-preview",  # The only OpenAI model
API_DEPLOYMENT_ID: "YOUR_AOAI_DEPLOYMENT", # The deployment id for the AOAI API
```
You can also non-visial model (e.g., GPT-4) for each agent, by setting `VISUAL_MODE: False` and proper `API_MODEL` (openai) and `API_DEPLOYMENT_ID` (aoai). You can also optionally set an backup LLM engine in the field of `BACKUP_AGENT` if the above engines failed during the inference.


####  Non-Visual Model Configuration
You can utilize non-visual models (e.g., GPT-4) for each agent by configuring the following settings in the `config.yaml` file:

- ```VISUAL_MODE: False # To enable non-visual mode.```
- Specify the appropriate `API_MODEL` (OpenAI) and `API_DEPLOYMENT_ID` (AOAI) for each agent.

Optionally, you can set a backup language model (LLM) engine in the `BACKUP_AGENT` field to handle cases where the primary engines fail during inference. Ensure you configure these settings accurately to leverage non-visual models effectively.

#### NOTE 💡 
UFO also supports other LLMs and advanced configurations, such as customize your own model, please check the [documents](https://microsoft.github.io/UFO/supported_models/overview/) for more details. Because of the limitations of model input, a lite version of the prompt is provided to allow users to experience it, which is configured in `config_dev.yaml`.

### 📔 Step 3: Additional Setting for RAG (optional).
If you want to enhance UFO's ability with external knowledge, you can optionally configure it with an external database for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) in the `ufo/config/config.yaml` file. 

We provide the following options for RAG to enhance UFO's capabilities:
- [Offline Help Document](https://microsoft.github.io/UFO/advanced_usage/reinforce_appagent/learning_from_help_document/) Enable UFO to retrieve information from offline help documents.
- [Online Bing Search Engine](https://microsoft.github.io/UFO/advanced_usage/reinforce_appagent/learning_from_bing_search/): Enhance UFO's capabilities by utilizing the most up-to-date online search results.
- [Self-Experience](https://microsoft.github.io/UFO/advanced_usage/reinforce_appagent/experience_learning/): Save task completion trajectories into UFO's memory for future reference.
- [User-Demonstration](https://microsoft.github.io/UFO/advanced_usage/reinforce_appagent/learning_from_demonstration/): Boost UFO's capabilities through user demonstration.

Consult their respective documentation for more information on how to configure these settings.

<!-- #### RAG from Offline Help Document
Before enabling this function, you need to create an offline indexer for your help document. Please refer to the [README](./learner/README.md) to learn how to create an offline vectored database for retrieval. You can enable this function by setting the following configuration:
```bash
## RAG Configuration for the offline docs
RAG_OFFLINE_DOCS: True  # Whether to use the offline RAG.
RAG_OFFLINE_DOCS_RETRIEVED_TOPK: 1  # The topk for the offline retrieved documents
```
Adjust `RAG_OFFLINE_DOCS_RETRIEVED_TOPK` to optimize performance.


####  RAG from Online Bing Search Engine
Enhance UFO's ability by utilizing the most up-to-date online search results! To use this function, you need to obtain a Bing search API key. Activate this feature by setting the following configuration:
```bash
## RAG Configuration for the Bing search
BING_API_KEY: "YOUR_BING_SEARCH_API_KEY"  # The Bing search API key
RAG_ONLINE_SEARCH: True  # Whether to use the online search for the RAG.
RAG_ONLINE_SEARCH_TOPK: 5  # The topk for the online search
RAG_ONLINE_RETRIEVED_TOPK: 1 # The topk for the online retrieved documents
```
Adjust `RAG_ONLINE_SEARCH_TOPK` and `RAG_ONLINE_RETRIEVED_TOPK` to get better performance.


#### RAG from Self-Demonstration
Save task completion trajectories into UFO's memory for future reference. This can improve its future success rates based on its previous experiences!

After completing a task, you'll see the following message:
```
Would you like to save the current conversation flow for future reference by the agent?
[Y] for yes, any other key for no.
```
Press `Y` to save it into its memory and enable memory retrieval via the following configuration:
```bash
## RAG Configuration for experience
RAG_EXPERIENCE: True  # Whether to use the RAG from its self-experience.
RAG_EXPERIENCE_RETRIEVED_TOPK: 5  # The topk for the offline retrieved documents
```

#### RAG from User-Demonstration
Boost UFO's capabilities through user demonstration! Utilize Microsoft Steps Recorder to record step-by-step processes for achieving specific tasks. With a simple command processed by the record_processor (refer to the [README](./record_processor/README.md)), UFO can store these trajectories in its memory for future reference, enhancing its learning from user interactions.

You can enable this function by setting the following configuration:
```bash
## RAG Configuration for demonstration
RAG_DEMONSTRATION: True  # Whether to use the RAG from its user demonstration.
