**UFO** is a **UI-Focused** dual-agent framework to fulfill user requests on **Windows OS** by seamlessly navigating and operating within individual or spanning multiple applications.

## 🕌 Framework
<b>UFO</b> <img src="./assets/ufo_blue.png" alt="UFO Image" width="24"> operates as a dual-agent framework, encompassing:
- <b>AppAgent 🤖</b>, tasked with choosing an application for fulfilling user requests. This agent may also switch to a different application when a request spans multiple applications, and the task is partially completed in the preceding application. 
- <b>ActAgent 👾</b>, responsible for iteratively executing actions on the selected applications until the task is successfully concluded within a specific application. 

Both agents leverage the multi-modal capabilities of GPT-Vision to comprehend the application UI and fulfill the user's request. For more details, please consult our technical report.

## 🆕 News
- 📅 2024-02-08 UFO is released on GitHub🎈.


## 💥 Highlights

- [x] **First Windows Agent** - UFO represents the first agent framework that can translate user request in natural language into grounded operation on Windows OS.
- [x] **Interactive Mode** - UFO allows for multiple sub-requests from users in the same session for completing complex task.
- [x] **Action Safeguard** - UFO supports safeguard to prompt for user confirmation when the action is sensitive.
- [x] **Easy Extension** - UFO is easy to extend to accomplish more complex tasks with different operations.



## ✨ Getting Started


### 🛠️ Step 1: Installation
UFO requires **Python >= 3.10** running on **Windows OS >= 10**. It can be installed by running the following command:
```bash
# [optional to create conda environment]
# conda create -n ufo python=3.10
# conda activate ufo

# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/UFO.git
cd UFO
# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ⚙️ Step 2: Configure the LLMs
Before running UFO, you need to provide your LLM configurations. Taking OpenAI as an example, you can configure `ufo/config/config.yaml` file as follows. 

#### OpenAI
```
API_TYPE: "openai" 
OPENAI_API_BASE: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" # The base URL for the OpenAI API
OPENAI_API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Set the value to the openai key for the llm model
OPENAI_API_MODEL: "GPTV_MODEL_NAME"  # The only OpenAI model by now that accepts visual input
```

#### Azure OpenAI (AOAI)
```
API_TYPE: "aoai" 
OPENAI_API_BASE: "YOUR_ENDPOINT" # The AOAI API endpoint
OPENAI_API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY"  # Set the value to the openai key for the llm model
OPENAI_API_MODEL: "GPTV_MODEL_NAME"  # The only OpenAI model by now that accepts visual input
```


### 🎉 Step 3: Start UFO

#### ⌨️ Command Line (CLI)

```bash
# assume you are in the cloned UFO folder
python -m ufo --task <your_task_name>
```

This will start the UFO process and you can interact with it through the command line interface. 
If everything goes well, you will see the following message:

```bash
Welcome to use UFO🛸, A UI-focused Agent for Windows OS Interaction. 
 _   _  _____   ___
| | | ||  ___| / _ \
| | | || |_   | | | |
| |_| ||  _|  | |_| |
 \___/ |_|     \___/
Please enter your request to be completed🛸:
```
#### **Reminder❗: Before UFO executing your request, please make sure the targeted applications are active on the system.**


###  Step 4 🎥: Execution Logs 

You can find the screenshots taken and request & reponse logs in the following folder:
```
./ufo/logs/<your_task_name>/
```
You may use them to debug, replay, or analyze the agent output.

## 📊 Evaluation

Please consult the [WindosBench](./DISCLAIMER.md) provided in Section A of the Appendix within our technical report. Here are some tips (and requirements) to aid in completing your request:

- Prior to UFO execution of your request, ensure that the targeted application is active (though it may be minimized).
- Occasionally, requests to GPT-V may trigger content safety measures. UFO will attempt to retry regardless, but adjusting the size or scale of the application window may prove helpful. We are actively solving this issue.
- Please note that the output of GPT-V may not consistently align with the same request. If unsuccessful with your initial attempt, consider trying again.
