## 🚀 What is UFO³ Galaxy?

**UFO³ Galaxy** is a revolutionary **cross-device orchestration framework** that transforms isolated device agents into a unified digital ecosystem. It models complex user requests as **Task Constellations** (星座) — dynamic distributed DAGs where nodes represent executable subtasks and edges capture dependencies across heterogeneous devices.

### 🎯 The Vision

Building truly ubiquitous intelligent agents requires moving beyond single-device automation. UFO³ Galaxy addresses four fundamental challenges in cross-device agent orchestration:

**🔄 Asynchronous Parallelism**  
Enabling concurrent task execution across multiple devices while maintaining correctness through event-driven coordination and safe concurrency control

**⚡ Dynamic Adaptation**  
Real-time workflow evolution in response to intermediate results, transient failures, and runtime observations without workflow abortion

**🌐 Distributed Coordination**  
Reliable, low-latency communication across heterogeneous devices via WebSocket-based Agent Interaction Protocol with fault tolerance

**🛡️ Safety Guarantees**  
Formal invariants ensuring DAG consistency during concurrent modifications and parallel execution, verified through rigorous proofs

  <p><em>UFO³ Galaxy Layered Architecture — From natural language to distributed execution</em></p>
</div>


### Layered Design

UFO³ Galaxy follows a **hierarchical orchestration model** that separates global coordination from local execution. This architecture enables scalable cross-device orchestration while maintaining consistent control and responsiveness across diverse operating systems and network environments.

#### 🎛️ Hierarchical Control Plane

**ConstellationClient** serves as the **global control plane**, maintaining a live registry of all connected device agents with their:
- Capability profiles and system specifications
- Runtime health metrics and availability status
- Current load and resource utilization

This registry enables intelligent task placement based on device capabilities, avoiding mismatches between task requirements and device capacity.

Each device hosts a **device agent server** that manages local orchestration through persistent WebSocket sessions with ConstellationClient. The server:
- Maintains execution contexts on the host
- Provides unified interface to underlying tools via MCP servers
- Handles task execution, telemetry streaming, and resource monitoring

**Clean separation**: Global orchestration policies are decoupled from device-specific heterogeneity, providing consistent abstraction across endpoints with different OS, hardware, or network conditions.

#### 🔄 Orchestration Flow

1. **DAG Synthesis**: ConstellationClient invokes the **Constellation Agent** to construct a TaskConstellation—a dynamic DAG encoding task decomposition, dependencies, and device mappings
2. **Device Assignment**: Each TaskStar (DAG node) is assigned to suitable device agents based on capability profiles and system load
3. **Asynchronous Execution**: The **Constellation Orchestrator** executes the DAG in an event-driven manner:
   - Task completions trigger dependent nodes
   - Failures prompt retry, migration, or partial DAG rewrites
   - Workflows adapt to real-time system dynamics (device churn, network variability)

**Result**: Highly parallel and resilient execution that sustains workflow completion even as subsets of devices fail or reconnect.

#### 🔌 Cross-Agent Communication

The **Agent Interaction Protocol (AIP)** handles all cross-agent interactions:
- Agent registration and capability synchronization
- Task dispatch and progress reporting  
- Result aggregation and telemetry streaming

Built on persistent WebSocket channels, AIP provides:
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead for control messages
- **Bidirectional**: Full-duplex communication between client and agents
- **Multiplexed**: Concurrent message streams over single connection
- **Low-latency**: Fast propagation of control signals and state updates
- **Resilient**: Maintains global consistency despite intermittent connectivity

Together, these design elements form a cohesive foundation for orchestrating large-scale, heterogeneous, and adaptive workflows across a resilient multi-device execution fabric.

---

## ✨ Core Design Principles

UFO³ Galaxy realizes cross-device orchestration through **five tightly integrated design principles**:

### 1. 🌟 Declarative Decomposition into Dynamic DAG (Task Constellation)

Natural-language or programmatic requests are decomposed by the **Constellation Agent** into a structured DAG of **TaskStars** (nodes) and **TaskStarLines** (edges) that encode workflow logic, dependencies, and device assignments. This declarative structure is amenable to automated scheduling, introspection, and dynamic modification throughout execution.

**Key Benefits:**
- 📋 **Declarative structure** for automated scheduling
- 🔍 **Runtime introspection** for workflow visibility
- ✏️ **Dynamic rewriting** throughout execution
- 🔄 **Automated orchestration** across heterogeneous devices

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Intent] --> B[Constellation Agent]
    B --> C[Task Constellation DAG]
    C --> D[TaskStar 1<br/>Windows]
    C --> E[TaskStar 2<br/>Linux GPU]
    C --> F[TaskStar 3<br/>Linux CPU]
    C --> G[TaskStar 4<br/>Mobile]
    E --> H[TaskStar 5]
    F --> H
    G --> H
```

### 2. 🔄 Continuous, Result-Driven Graph Evolution

The **Task Constellation** is a **living data structure** that evolves in response to execution feedback. Intermediate outputs, transient failures, and new observations trigger controlled rewrites—adding diagnostic TaskStars, creating fallbacks, rewiring dependencies, or pruning completed nodes—so the system adapts dynamically instead of aborting on errors.

**Adaptation Mechanisms:**
- 🩺 **Diagnostic TaskStars** added for debugging
- 🛡️ **Fallback creation** for error recovery
- 🔗 **Dependency rewiring** for workflow optimization
- ✂️ **Node pruning** after completion

The **Constellation Agent** operates in two modes:
- **Creation Mode**: Synthesizes initial DAG from user request with device-aware task decomposition
- **Editing Mode**: Incrementally refines constellation based on task completion events and runtime feedback

[Learn more →](constellation_agent/overview.md)

### 3. 🎯 Heterogeneous, Asynchronous, and Safe Orchestration

Each **Task Star** is matched to the most suitable device agent via rich **Agent Profiles** reflecting OS, hardware capabilities, and installed tools. The **Constellation Orchestrator** executes tasks asynchronously, allowing multiple TaskStars to progress in parallel.

**Safety Guarantees:**
- 🔒 **Safe assignment locking** prevents race conditions
- 📅 **Event-driven scheduling** monitors DAG readiness
- ✅ **DAG consistency checks** maintain structural integrity
- 🔄 **Batched edits** ensure atomicity
- 📐 **Formal verification** reinforces correctness
- ⏱️ **Timeout protection** prevents deadlocks

These mechanisms collectively ensure **high efficiency without compromising reliability**.

### 4. 🔌 Unified Agent Interaction Protocol (AIP)

Built atop persistent **WebSocket channels**, AIP provides a unified, secure, and fault-tolerant layer for the entire agent ecosystem.

**Core Capabilities:**
- 📝 **Agent registry** with capability profiles
- 🔐 **Session management** for secure communication
- 📤 **Task dispatch** with intelligent routing
- 🎯 **Coordination primitives** for distributed workflows
- 💓 **Heartbeat monitoring** for health tracking
- 🔌 **Automatic reconnection** under network fluctuations
- 🔄 **Retry mechanisms** for reliability

**Architecture Benefits:**
- 🪶 **Lightweight interface** for easy integration
- 🧩 **Extensible design** supports new agent types
- 🛡️ **Fault tolerance** ensures continuous operation

This protocol **abstracts OS and network heterogeneity**, enabling seamless collaboration among agents across desktops, servers, and edge devices, while allowing new agents to integrate seamlessly into the UFO³ ecosystem.

### 5. 🛠️ Template-Driven Framework for Device Agents

To **democratize agent creation**, UFO³ provides a **lightweight development template and toolkit** for rapidly building new device agents.

**Development Framework:**
- 📄 **Capability declaration** defines agent profiles
- 🔗 **Environment binding** connects to local systems
- 🧩 **MCP server integration** for tool augmentation
- 🔧 **Modular design** accelerates development

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration:**
- 🎁 **Tool packages** via MCP servers
- 🔌 **Plug-and-play** capability extension
- 🌐 **Cross-platform** tool standardization
- 🚀 **Rapid prototyping** of new agents

This modular architecture maintains consistency across the constellation while enabling developers to extend UFO³ to new platforms (mobile, web, IoT, embedded systems, etc.) with minimal effort.

**🔌 Extensibility:** UFO³ is designed as a **universal framework** that supports developing new device agents for different platforms (mobile, web, IoT, embedded systems, etc.) and applications. Through the **Agent Interaction Protocol (AIP)**, custom device agents can seamlessly integrate into UFO³ Galaxy for coordinated multi-device automation. **Want to build your own device agent?** See our [Creating Custom Device Agents tutorial](../tutorials/creating_device_agent/overview.md) to learn how to extend UFO³ to new platforms.

## 🌟 From Devices to Constellations to Galaxy

UFO³ represents a paradigm shift in intelligent automation:

- **Single Device** → Isolated agents operating within one OS
- **Task Constellation** → Coordinated multi-device workflows for one task
- **Digital Agent Galaxy** → Interconnected constellations spanning your entire digital estate

Over time, multiple constellations can interconnect, weaving together agents, devices, and capabilities into a self-organizing **Digital Agent Galaxy**. This design elevates cross-device automation from a brittle engineering challenge to a unified orchestration paradigm, where multi-device workflows become naturally expressive, paving the way for large-scale, adaptive, and resilient intelligent ubiquitous computing systems.

## 📊 Performance Monitoring & Evaluation

UFO³ Galaxy provides comprehensive performance monitoring and evaluation tools to analyze multi-device workflow execution:

### Automated Metrics Collection

Galaxy automatically collects detailed performance metrics during execution through an event-driven observer pattern:

- **Task Metrics**: Execution times, success rates, bottleneck identification
- **Constellation Metrics**: DAG statistics, parallelism analysis, critical path computation
- **Modification Metrics**: Dynamic editing patterns and adaptation frequency
- **Device Metrics**: Per-device performance and resource utilization

All metrics are captured in real-time without impacting execution performance and saved to structured JSON files for programmatic analysis.

### Trajectory Report

Galaxy automatically generates a comprehensive Markdown trajectory report (`output.md`) documenting the complete execution lifecycle:

```
logs/galaxy/<task_name>/output.md
```

This human-readable report includes:
- Step-by-step execution timeline with agent actions
- Interactive DAG topology visualizations showing constellation evolution
- Detailed task execution logs with results and errors
- Device connection status and coordination events
- Complete before/after constellation states at each step

The trajectory report provides visual debugging and workflow understanding, complementing the quantitative `result.json` metrics.

### Result JSON Format

After each session, Galaxy also generates a comprehensive `result.json` file containing:

```
logs/galaxy/<task_name>/result.json
```

This file includes:
- Complete session metadata and execution timeline
- Task-by-task performance breakdown
- Constellation statistics (parallelism ratio, critical path, max concurrency)
- Modification history showing DAG evolution
- Final results and outcomes

**Example Key Metrics:**

| Metric | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `parallelism_ratio` | Efficiency of parallel execution (total_work / critical_path) | Optimization target |
| `critical_path_length` | Minimum possible execution time | Theoretical performance limit |
| `average_task_duration` | Mean task execution time | Baseline performance |
| `modification_count` | Number of dynamic DAG edits | Adaptability analysis |

### Performance Analysis Tools

```python
import json

# Load session results
with open("logs/galaxy/task_32/result.json", 'r') as f:
    result = json.load(f)

# Extract key metrics
metrics = result["session_results"]["metrics"]
task_stats = metrics["task_statistics"]
const_stats = result["session_results"]["final_constellation_stats"]

print(f"✅ Success Rate: {task_stats['success_rate'] * 100:.1f}%")
print(f"⏱️  Avg Task Duration: {task_stats['average_task_duration']:.2f}s")
print(f"🔀 Parallelism Ratio: {const_stats['parallelism_ratio']:.2f}")
```
