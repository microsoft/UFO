# Disclaimer: Code Execution and Data Handling Notice

By choosing to run the provided code, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms and conditions regarding the functionality and data handling practices:

## 1. Code Functionality:
The code you are about to execute has the capability to capture screenshots of your working desktop environment and active applications. These screenshots will be processed and sent to the GPT model for inference.


## 2. Data Privacy and Storage:
It is crucial to note that Microsoft, the provider of this code, explicitly states that it does not collect or save any of the transmitted data. The captured screenshots are processed in real-time for the purpose of inference, and no permanent storage or record of this data is retained by Microsoft.

## 3. User Responsibility:
By running the code, you understand and accept the responsibility for the content and nature of the data present on your desktop during the execution period. It is your responsibility to ensure that no sensitive or confidential information is visible or captured during this process.

## 4. Security Measures:
Microsoft has implemented security measures to safeguard the action execution. However, it is recommended that you run the code in a secure and controlled environment to minimize potential risks. Ensure that you are running the latest security updates on your system.

## 5. Consent for Inference:
You explicitly provide consent for the GPT model to analyze the captured screenshots for the purpose of generating relevant outputs. This consent is inherent in the act of executing the code.

## 6. No Guarantee of Accuracy:
The outputs generated by the GPT model are based on patterns learned during training and may not always be accurate or contextually relevant. Microsoft does not guarantee the accuracy or suitability of the inferences made by the model.

## 7. Indemnification:
Users agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Microsoft harmless from and against all damages, costs, and attorneys' fees in connection with any claims arising from the use of this Repo.

## 8. Reporting Infringements:
If anyone believes that this Repo infringes on their rights, please notify the project owner via the provided project owner email. Microsoft will investigate and take appropriate actions as necessary.

## 9. Modifications to the Disclaimer:
Microsoft reserves the right to update or modify this disclaimer at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review the disclaimer periodically for any changes.
