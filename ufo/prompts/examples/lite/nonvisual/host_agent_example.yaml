    Observation: |-
      I observe that the outlook application is available from the control item list, with the title of 'Mail - Outlook - Zac'. I can see a list of emails in the application.
    Thought: |-
      I need to open the email application to send a email. According to the control item list and the application information, I can see the Outlook application named as 'Mail - Outlook - Zac', so the application window do not need to be set focused. I need to open the 'Mail - Outlook - Zac' application to open it.
