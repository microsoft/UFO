    Draft an email to Amy to ask her how she feels about the new project.
  Sub-task: |-
    Draft an email to send to Amy (amy@gmail.com) to ask her how she feels about the new project on the outlook application.
  Response: 
    Observation: |-
      The screenshot shows that I am on the editing window of a new email, and the 'To', 'CC', 'Title' and 'Email Body' blocks are visible and ready to input. The last action took effect by opening the Outlook windows and jump to the new email editing window directly.
    Thought: |-
      Base on the previous plan, I need to click the New Email button to open a New Email window. But the screenshot shows that the New Email window has already opened. I can now take mutiple actions of filling the fields of 'To', 'Title' and 'Email Body' at a single step.
    Actions:
      - Function: set_edit_text
        Args: {"text": "amy@gmail.com"}

        Status: FINISH
    Plan:
      - (1) After I draft the content of the email, the task is finished. I do not need to send the email since the user did not ask me to send it.
    Comment: |-
      I revised the previous plan base on the screenshot since I observe that New Email window has already opened and the title of email has already been inputted. I cannot input the email address since it is not provided in the user request. Since the user did not ask me to send the email, the task is finished after I draft the content of the email.
    SaveScreenshot:
      {"save": false, "reason": ""}
  Tips: |-
    - The user only asked me to draft an email to Amy to ask her how she feels about the new project. I do not need to send the email since the user did not ask me to send it.
    - You need to draft the content of the email and send it to the receiver. Use polite language when drafting the email.

  Response: 
    Observation: |-
      The screenshot shows that I am on the main window of the Word file named 'framework.docx'. The text of the file, which I am interest, is visible in the screenshot. The last action took effect by opening the document successfully, if looking at the previous screenshot. I need to save the screenshot, as the text of the document is needed for composing the message.
    Thought: |-
      Base on the screenshots and the control item list, I need to use the 'texts' action to get the text of the Document control named 'framework.docx'. Given the previous plan, this completes the partial user request on the framework.docx, and therefore I need to set the status as 'FINISH' immediately.
    Actions:
      - Function: texts
        Args: {}
        ControlLabel: 83
        ControlText: framework - Word
        Status: FINISH
    Plan:
      - <FINISH>
    Comment: |-
      The partial tasks on 'framework.docx' is completed once I take the current action. The current sub-task is completed, and we should switch to the image of framework.png to complete the next task.
    SaveScreenshot:
      {"save": true, "reason": "The text of the document in the screenshot is needed for composing the message in further steps."}
  Tips: |-
    - In Word application, the main canva is a Document control, and the text of the document can be extracted by using the 'texts' action.

      - (4) Click the 'Inspect' button, to inspect the ppt for notes.
