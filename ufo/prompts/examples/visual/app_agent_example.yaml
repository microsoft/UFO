      Successfully clicked the 'New Email' button in Outlook to initiate email composition. The action will open a new email editing window where the recipient (jack@outlook.com), subject line, and email body can be filled in. The subtask is in progress (CONTINUE status) as additional steps are required to complete the email composition: inputting the recipient's email address, adding the subject line 'Thanks for your contribution on the open source', composing the thank-you message body, and clicking the Send button. The new email window is now ready for the next input actions.
  Tips: 
    - Sending an email is a sensitive action that needs to be confirmed by the user before the execution.
    - You need to draft the content of the email and send it to the receiver.

      The screenshot shows that I am on the editing window of a new email, and the 'To', 'CC', 'Title' and 'Email Body' blocks are visible and ready to input.

      I revised the previous plan base on the screenshot since I observe that New Email window has already opened and the title of email has already been inputted. I cannot input the email address since it is not provided in the user request. Since the user did not ask me to send the email, the task is finished after I draft the content of the email.

    result: |-
      Successfully completed drafting an email to Amy asking about her feelings on the new project. The email body has been filled in the 'Email Body' control (ID: 36) with a polite message requesting Amy's feedback on the new project. The subtask is marked as FINISH because: (1) the email content has been successfully drafted as requested, (2) the user did not request the email to be sent, only drafted, and (3) the recipient's email address was not provided in the original request. The email remains in draft state within the Outlook new email window, ready for the user to add Amy's email address and send manually if desired. Key observation: The email title was already pre-filled when the window opened.
  Tips: 
    - The user only asked me to draft an email to Amy to ask her how she feels about the new project. I do not need to send the email since the user did not ask me to send it.
    - You need to draft the content of the email and send it to the receiver. Use polite language when drafting the email.

      Successfully completed the search for the word 'UFO' in the Word document. The search query 'UFO' was already inputted in the 'Find' control from a previous action, and the 'Find' button (ID: 59) has now been clicked to execute the search. The subtask is marked as FINISH because the search operation has been initiated and Word will highlight all instances of 'UFO' in the document. The user can now view the search results directly in the document, with all occurrences of 'UFO' highlighted or navigated to by Word's search functionality. No additional actions are required from the agent as the search request has been fully satisfied.
  Tips: 
    - If there are steps already taken (e.g., the required text is already inputted edit box), you do not need to repeat them. You can skip the steps that have already been taken and move to the next step.

  Response: 
    observation: |-
      The screenshot shows that I am on the main window of the Word file named 'framework.docx'. The text of the file, which I am interest, is visible in the screenshot. The last action took effect by opening the document successfully, if looking at the previous screenshot. I need to save the screenshot, as the text of the document is needed for composing the message.
    thought: |-
      Base on the screenshots and the control item list, I need to use the 'texts' action to get the text of the Document control named 'framework.docx'.

      Successfully completed the extraction of full text from 'framework.docx'. The 'texts' action was executed on the Document control (ID: 83, name: 'framework - Word') to retrieve all textual content from the Word document. The subtask is marked as FINISH because the text extraction portion of the user's request has been completed. Key artifacts: (1) The extracted text from framework.docx is now available for use in composing the Teams message to Tom, (2) A screenshot has been saved containing the visible document text for reference in subsequent steps. Next steps: The overall task requires switching focus to analyze the framework.png image to extract a detailed description of the workflow, which will be combined with this extracted text to compose the final message to Tom on Teams.
  Tips: 
    - In Word application, the main canva is a Document control, and the text of the document can be extracted by using the 'texts' action.

  Response: 
    observation: |-
      The current screenshot shows the PowerPoint application with the 'presentation.pptx' file open. The 'File Tab' button is visible, which is needed to access the backstage view where the 'Check for Issues' option is located. This matches the next step in the previous plan. The application appears to be in the normal editing view, and no backstage view or other menus are open at this time.
    thought: |-
      The user request to do it quickly. To make the task more efficient, I need to use some fast but niche tricks using the 'Remove All Presentation Notes' function.  To do so, I need to first click the 'File' button to open the menu.

      - (4) Click the 'Inspect' button, to inspect the ppt for notes.
      - (5) I should now find and click the 'Remove All Presentation Notes'. However, this button is usually at the bottom of the menu, and therefore I should apply wheel_mouse_input(wheel_dist=-20) to a ScrollBar to reach the menu bottom to make this button visible.
      - (6) Once 'Remove All Presentation Notes' is visible, I should click it to remove all notes in the presentation.pptx file. This action is sensitive to the system and need to be confirmed by the user.

      Successfully initiated the process to quickly remove all notes from presentation.pptx using PowerPoint's built-in 'Remove All Presentation Notes' function. The 'File' button (ID: 59) has been clicked to access the backstage view. The subtask is in progress (CONTINUE status) as multiple additional steps are required: (1) navigate to the Info page, (2) access the 'Check for Issues' menu, (3) open the Document Inspector, (4) scroll down to locate the 'Remove All Presentation Notes' button, and (5) execute the removal (which requires user confirmation as it's a sensitive system action). This approach avoids the inefficient method of looping through individual slides, providing a much faster solution for bulk note removal. The File menu is now open and ready for the next navigation step.
  Tips: |-
    - The 'Remove All Presentation Notes' function is the fastest way to remove all notes in the presentation.pptx file. I should use this function to complete the task quickly instead of looping through each slide.
    - The 'Remove All Presentation Notes' is usually at the bottom of the menu, and I should apply wheel_mouse_input(wheel_dist=-20) to a ScrollBar to reach the menu bottom to make this button visible.

      Successfully clicked on the estimated coordinates (x: 0.35, y: 0.4) to activate the title text box on the first slide of presentation.pptx in Microsoft PowerPoint. The subtask is in progress (CONTINUE status) as one final step remains: inputting the title text 'Project Update' into the now-active title text box. The click action was necessary because the title text box was not available as a clickable control item in the UI automation tree, requiring the use of coordinate-based clicking to activate it. Key observation: The title text box is located on the slide canvas at the top of the first slide, and the estimated coordinates should have successfully focused the text input cursor into this field. The next action will complete the user's request by entering the specified title text.
  Tips: |-
    - If the control item is not available in the control item list and screenshot, you can use the 'click_on_coordinates' API to click on a specific point in the application window.
