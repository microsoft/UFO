      Subtask in CONTINUE state. Successfully clicked the 'New Email' button (ID: 1) in Outlook to initiate email composition. The action will open a new email editing window where the recipient (jack@outlook.com), subject line, and email body can be filled in. No email has been drafted or sent yet. Remaining steps include: (1) inputting recipient email address jack@outlook.com in the 'To' field, (2) entering subject line 'Thanks for your contribution on the open source', (3) composing a detailed and professional thank-you message body using sender name Zac, and (4) clicking Send button (requires user confirmation as this is a sensitive action). The new email window is now ready for subsequent input actions to complete the email composition subtask.
  Tips: |-
    - Sending an email is a sensitive action that needs to be confirmed by the user before the execution.
    - You need to draft the content of the email and send it to the receiver.

  Request: |-
    Draft an email to Amy to ask her how she feels about the new project.
  Sub-task: |-
    Draft an email to send to Amy (amy@gmail.com) to ask her how she feels about the new project on the outlook application.
  Response: 
    observation: |-
      The screenshot shows that I am on the editing window of a new email, and the 'To', 'CC', 'Title' and 'Email Body' blocks are visible and ready to input. The last action took effect by opening the Outlook windows and jump to the new email editing window directly.
    thought: |-
      Base on the previous plan, I need to click the New Email button to open a New Email window. But the screenshot shows that the New Email window has already opened. I can now take mutiple actions of filling the fields of 'To', 'Title' and 'Email Body' at a single step.
    action:
      - function: set_edit_text
        arguments: {"text": "amy@gmail.com", id: "33", name: "To"}
        status: CONTINUE

        status: FINISH
    plan:
      - (1) After I draft the content of the email, the task is finished. I do not need to send the email since the user did not ask me to send it.
    comment: |-
      I revised the previous plan base on the screenshot since I observe that New Email window has already opened and the title of email has already been inputted. I cannot input the email address since it is not provided in the user request. Since the user did not ask me to send the email, the task is finished after I draft the content of the email.
    save_screenshot:
      {"save": false, "reason": ""}
    result: |-
      Subtask successfully completed in FINISH state. Three form fields were populated simultaneously in the new email composition window: (1) 'To' field (ID: 33) set to amy@gmail.com, (2) 'Title' field (ID: 34) set to 'Inquiry about the Feedback on the New Project', and (3) 'Email Body' field (ID: 36) filled with a polite inquiry message asking Amy for feedback on the new project. The email draft is now complete and ready in the Outlook editing window. The user did not request sending the email, so the subtask concludes at the drafting stage. No send action was taken. The email remains in draft state for the user to review and send manually if desired. All requested content has been successfully composed with professional and courteous language.
  Tips: |-
    - The user only asked me to draft an email to Amy to ask her how she feels about the new project. I do not need to send the email since the user did not ask me to send it.
    - You need to draft the content of the email and send it to the receiver. Use polite language when drafting the email.

  Request: |-
    Search for the word 'UFO' in the document.
  Sub-task: |-
    Search for the word 'UFO' in the document on the Word application.
  Response: 
    observation: |-
      The screenshot shows that I am on the editing window of a Word file. The search box is visible and the word 'UFO' is already inputted. The previous action of inputting 'UFO' took effect based on the screenshot of the last step.
    thought: |-
      Base on the screenshots, the word 'UFO' is already inputted in the Edit control named 'Find'. I need to click the Find button to search for the word 'UFO' in the document, and the task is finished.
    action:

      I searched for the word 'UFO' in the document successfully. The user should view the search result.
    save_screenshot:
      {"save": false, "reason": ""}
    result: |-
      Subtask successfully completed in FINISH state. Clicked the 'Find' button (ID: 59) to execute the search for the word 'UFO' in the Word document. The search term 'UFO' was already pre-filled in the 'Find' control from a previous action, so no additional text input was required. The search operation has now been initiated and Word will highlight all instances of 'UFO' throughout the document, allowing the user to navigate between occurrences. The subtask is complete as the search functionality has been activated. The user can now visually review all search results and navigate through matched instances using Word's built-in search navigation controls. No errors encountered during execution.
  Tips: |-
    - If there are steps already taken (e.g., the required text is already inputted edit box), you do not need to repeat them. You can skip the steps that have already been taken and move to the next step. 


example4:
  Request: |-
    Send an message to Tom on Teams by including a (1) the text extracted from framework.docx, (2) and a detailed description of the workflow of the framework in the image of framework.png.
  Sub-task: |-
    Extract the full text from the framework.docx.
  Response: 
    observation: |-
      The screenshot shows that I am on the main window of the Word file named 'framework.docx'. The text of the file, which I am interest, is visible in the screenshot. The last action took effect by opening the document successfully, if looking at the previous screenshot. I need to save the screenshot, as the text of the document is needed for composing the message.
    thought: |-
      Base on the screenshots and the control item list, I need to use the 'texts' action to get the text of the Document control named 'framework.docx'. Given the previous plan, this completes the partial user request on the framework.docx, and therefore I need to set the status as 'FINISH' immediately.
    action:
      - function: texts
        arguments: {"id": "83", "name": "framework - Word"}
        status: FINISH
    comment: |-
      The partial tasks on 'framework.docx' is completed once I take the current action. The current sub-task is completed, and we should switch to the image of framework.png to complete the next task.
    save_screenshot:
      {"save": true, "reason": "The text of the document in the screenshot is needed for composing the message in further steps."}
    result: |-
      Subtask successfully completed in FINISH state. Extracted the full text content from the 'framework.docx' Word document using the 'texts' function on the Document control (ID: 83, name: 'framework - Word'). The extracted text is now available for downstream processing and will be used to compose the Teams message to Tom. A screenshot was saved (save: true) because the visible document text is needed for reference in subsequent steps. This completes the first part of the overall user request. Remaining tasks include: switching to the framework.png image window to analyze and summarize the workflow visualization, then combining both the extracted text and the workflow description into a comprehensive message to send to Tom on Teams. No errors encountered; text extraction artifact successfully obtained.
  Tips: |-
    - In Word application, the main canva is a Document control, and the text of the document can be extracted by using the 'texts' action.

    Remove all notes in the presentation.pptx file quickly without looping through each slide.
  Response: 
    observation: |-
      The current screenshot shows the PowerPoint application with the 'presentation.pptx' file open. The 'File Tab' button is visible, which is needed to access the backstage view where the 'Check for Issues' option is located. This matches the next step in the previous plan. The application appears to be in the normal editing view, and no backstage view or other menus are open at this time.
    thought: |-
      The user request to do it quickly. To make the task more efficient, I need to use some fast but niche tricks using the 'Remove All Presentation Notes' function.  To do so, I need to first click the 'File' button to open the menu.
    action:
      - function: click_input
        arguments: {"button": "left", "double": false, id: "59", name: "File"}
        status: CONTINUE

      - (2) Click the 'Check for Issues' MenuItem, to open a menu for checking.
      - (3) Click the 'Inspect Document', to open a document inspector.
      - (4) Click the 'Inspect' button, to inspect the ppt for notes.
      - (5) I should now find and click the 'Remove All Presentation Notes'. However, this button is usually at the bottom of the menu, and therefore I should apply wheel_mouse_input(wheel_dist=-20) to a ScrollBar to reach the menu bottom to make this button visible.
      - (6) Once 'Remove All Presentation Notes' is visible, I should click it to remove all notes in the presentation.pptx file. This action is sensitive to the system and need to be confirmed by the user.
    comment: |-
      I plan to use the 'Remove All Presentation Notes' function. This is the fastest way to remove all notes in the presentation.pptx file.
    save_screenshot:
      {"save": false, "reason": ""}
    result: |-
      Subtask in CONTINUE state. Successfully clicked the 'File' button (ID: 59) in PowerPoint to access the backstage view, which is the entry point for the 'Remove All Presentation Notes' function. The File menu is now opening and will provide access to the Info page and document inspection tools. No notes have been removed yet. Remaining steps to complete the bulk note removal: (1) click 'Info' list item to navigate to Info page, (2) click 'Check for Issues' menu item to reveal inspection options, (3) click 'Inspect Document' to launch the document inspector dialog, (4) click 'Inspect' button to scan the presentation for notes, (5) scroll down in the inspector results (using wheel_mouse_input with wheel_dist=-20 on ScrollBar) to reveal the 'Remove All Presentation Notes' button at the bottom, and (6) click 'Remove All Presentation Notes' button (requires user confirmation as sensitive action) to bulk-delete all notes across all slides. This approach avoids inefficient slide-by-slide iteration.
  Tips: |-
    - The 'Remove All Presentation Notes' function is the fastest way to remove all notes in the presentation.pptx file. I should use this function to complete the task quickly instead of looping through each slide.
    - The 'Remove All Presentation Notes' is usually at the bottom of the menu, and I should apply wheel_mouse_input(wheel_dist=-20) to a ScrollBar to reach the menu bottom to make this button visible.

    result: |-
      Subtask in CONTINUE state. Successfully executed two actions simultaneously: (1) entered the search query 'Imdiffusion GitHub' into the Google search ComboBox (ID: 36, name: '搜索'), and (2) clicked the search button (ID: 18, name: '搜一搜') to initiate the search. The search is now being executed and results should load shortly. No star count has been obtained yet. Remaining steps to answer the user's question: (1) wait for search results to load and become visible, (2) identify and click the hyperlink to the official Imdiffusion GitHub repository from the search results list, (3) wait for the repository page to load, (4) visually locate the star count displayed on the GitHub repo page (typically shown near the top-right with a star icon), and (5) extract and report the exact number of stars to the user. This efficient multi-action approach combines text input and search submission in a single step, reducing total action count.
  Tips: |-
    - The search box is usually in a type of ComboBox.
    - The number of stars of a Github repo page can be found in the repo page visually.

The plan outlines subsequent actions needed: clicking the newly created task ListItem to open details view, adding three structured steps ('Menu Planning and Ingredient Acquisition', 'Meal Preparation Schedule', 'Setting Up the Dining Area'), adding a note about dietary considerations, and closing the details view. The current subtask (basic task creation) is marked FINISH, but the overall user request will require follow-up subtasks to add the detailed steps and notes to make this a comprehensive reminder with actionable guidance.
  Tips: |-
    - You need to add more details for the task, including adding steps and notes.
    - You need to add each step one by one and add notes to the task.

      The current screenshot shows that I am on the Microsoft PowerPoint application. The first slide of the presentation.pptx is visible in the screenshot and a title text box is on the top of the slide.
    thought: |-
      I need to input the title 'Project Update' in the title text box of the first slide of the presentation.pptx. The title text box is on the canvas which is not a control item, thus I need to first estimate the relative fractional x and y coordinates of the point to click on and activate the title text box. The estimated coordinates of the point to click on are (0.35, 0.4).
    action:
      - function: click_on_coordinates

      I need to estimate the relative fractional x and y coordinates of the point to click on and activate the title text box, so that I can input the title 'Project Update'.
    result: |-
      Subtask in CONTINUE state. Successfully clicked on the estimated coordinates (x: 0.35, y: 0.4) using click_on_coordinates to activate the title text box on the first slide of presentation.pptx. This coordinate-based click was necessary because the title text box was not available as a discrete control item in the UI automation tree, requiring spatial clicking on the slide canvas. The title text box should now be active and ready for text input. Remaining step: input the title text 'Project Update' into the now-focused title placeholder. Once the text is entered, the subtask will be complete with the first slide displaying the requested title. The coordinate-based approach is useful when working with PowerPoint slide elements that are rendered on the canvas rather than exposed as individual UI controls, allowing direct interaction with visual elements at specific screen positions.
  Tips: |-
    - If the control item is not available in the control item list and screenshot, you can use the 'click_on_coordinates' API to click on a specific point in the application window.
